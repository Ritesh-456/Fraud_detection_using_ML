# D:\Projects\Fraud Detection using ML\Fraud_detection_using_ML\.env

# This file stores environment variables for the application.
# These variables are loaded by the 'python-dotenv' library in your Python scripts (e.g., app.py, handler.py).
# Keep this file secure and do not commit it to public version control if it contains sensitive production credentials.
# For local development, storing credentials here is common practice.

# SECRET_KEY:
# A strong, random string used by Flask to sign session cookies and for other security purposes.
# Change this value for production and keep it secret. You can generate a new one using Python:
# import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(24)) or os.urandom(24)
SECRET_KEY='a25c29160c03ba0aae322a3b20ce454d44276466c3cf4b30' # Replace with your actual secret key

# Database Credentials:
# Connection details for the MySQL database used to store user information and analysis history.
# Ensure these match your local MySQL server configuration.
DB_USER='root'              # Your MySQL username (e.g., 'root')
DB_PASSWORD='1234qwer!@#$QWER' # Your MySQL password
DB_NAME='fraud_detection_db' # The name of the database you created (as defined in schema.sql)
# Optional: If your DB is not on localhost or a standard port, add these:
# DB_HOST='127.0.0.1'         # Database host (e.g., 'localhost', '127.0.0.1', or an IP address)
# DB_PORT='3306'              # Database port (default for MySQL is 3306)
